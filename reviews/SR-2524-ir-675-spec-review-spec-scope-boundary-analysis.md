## Summary

Ticket: IR-675. Reviewer session dcb5e3e7-8fe4-422e-aef1-3ca57d78bee2, model claude-opus-5-5, run e86ea724-594f-49cb-ad01-8568cc4c64d8. Reviewed head 47dd57f79207eb4517e318752e316e696c9974bb against measured main 5ab6249658d9bd5f8977b95991b55cb9af1e7522; SPEC-only diff of three files. Method: spec-review/spec-scope-boundary-analysis.

System and responsibility boundaries of the amendment: which refusals it covers (generic guardian startup/observation causes crossing a process-role boundary), what stays local-role, what remains AC-39's native-policy allocation, and what is left CODE-gated. Producer inventory context is read-only at agent-ix/quire-contract-codegen@8fbf08f907f31f7768c5644dfe17481b0684e361 (unmerged IR-639 WIP, read via git show only).

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Summary | Refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FND-001 | medium | The amendment's scope 'generic guardian startup/observation causes' is not bounded by a list of refusal sites, phases or roles, while the producer inventory includes Other-wrapped TryReserveError producers on control and report paths (control.rs:703-704, 1127-1132 ControlError::Io(io::Error::other(error)); report_storage.rs:467-472) whose failures are neither clearly startup nor observation; for those causes it is not stated whether the new representation or the unrelaxed original-cause wording governs. Scenario: A control-receive buffer reservation in O fails during settlement and its cause is carried to C. One implementer applies the new opaque-loss table; another reads the cause as outside 'startup/observation' and, under line 664's 'No other original-cause retention obligation is relaxed', requires the original object, which lines 823-824 concede cannot cross processes. Neither choice is testable against the spec text. | spec/kani/functional/FR-034-caller-death-ownership.md:822; spec/kani/functional/FR-034-caller-death-ownership.md:814; src/kani/run/control.rs:703-704,1127-1132 (WIP); src/kani/run/report_storage.rs:467-472 (WIP) |

## Verdict

The local-role/cross-role split, the AC-39 carve-out and the 'no public role/stage query' boundary are explicit, and the generic boxed branch stays CODE-gated. One medium boundary gap: 'startup/observation' is not bounded by a site or role list, while cross-role-capable opaque producers also exist on control and report paths.
