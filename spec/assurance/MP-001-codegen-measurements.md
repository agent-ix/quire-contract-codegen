# Contract codegen v0.1 measurement plan

## Decision Use

Measurements inform the human v0.1 source-release decision for one pinned candidate; they do not
approve release or confer validation, accreditation, or certification.

## Population

The population is every public IR construct and positive/negative canonical fixture, all supported
executable/proptest/Kani/coverage backends, supported platforms, output types, diagnostics, dependency
states, and injected publication failure points.

## Collection Procedure

Foundation runs use `scripts/collect_foundation_evidence.sh`. Implementation plans will extend this
with a stable candidate runner that records source and dependency revisions, tool/backend versions,
configuration, corpus/input digests, repeated bundle digests, compile/proptest/Kani/coverage results,
fault-injection outcomes, differential dispositions, and output digests beneath `evidence/`.

## Interpretation

Exact digest equality is required only within a declared supported profile. A missing backend, draft
dependency, unsupported fixture, inconclusive proof, or differential result remains a limitation, not
a pass. Foundation evidence cannot support a semantic implementation or release decision.
