# FR-015: Generate separate bounded Kani obligations for complete-V1 oracles

## Description

When a caller selects Kani generation for complete-V1 contracts whose scalar
oracles FR-014 generated, the code generator shall emit one bounded Kani
obligation per precondition, postcondition, invariant and frame condition,
each pinned to its backend identity and model-domain bounds. This is issue
#49.

## Inputs

- The FR-014 oracle crate and claim map for the contract's expressions.
- Contract IR's lowered claims and bounds for each obligation. Bounds come
  only from the lowered IR `bounded_domain` nodes, never from a caller
  descriptor.
- The pins: the Kani launcher and driver executable digests, the Kani version,
  the CBMC version, solver and options, the unwind bound, the adapter profile,
  the FR-014 oracle crate digest, and the Contract Runtime revision.
- A complete request. A postcondition or invariant is proved under the
  preconditions of its own anchor operation, so the request must name every
  package precondition sharing that anchor as an item of the same request. The
  caller does not choose a solver on this path; FR-003's caller-supplied solver
  is not carried into separate-obligation lowering.
- The loop unwind bound, which is a request-level value in `1..=1024`.

## Outputs

- One Kani harness per obligation kind and claim, with its bounds and every
  pin recorded in its identity.
- Exactly one non-vacuity cover per harness, which is what distinguishes a
  proof from a harness whose assumptions are jointly unsatisfiable.
- For a postcondition or invariant, the assumed preconditions recorded in the
  harness identity's embedded oracles, so a reader can see the claim actually
  proved rather than the claim the clause states alone.
- A typed refusal for each obligation that has no finite encoding.

## Behavior

- When generating proofs, the generator shall emit precondition,
  postcondition, invariant and frame obligations as separate harnesses.
- When an obligation has a finite model domain, the generator shall bound
  every symbolic input by that domain without assuming away refused,
  undefined or incomplete outcomes.
- If an obligation's domain is unbounded or its family lacks a finite
  encoding, then the generator shall refuse it with a typed reason and emit no
  harness.
- If an obligation's bounds are unsatisfiable, so that the harness would hold
  vacuously, then the generator shall refuse it with a typed reason and emit no
  harness.
- If an obligation depends on an FR-014 oracle whose operation identity is
  `caller_declared`, then the generator shall refuse it with a typed reason
  naming that blocked item and emit no harness.
- The generator shall end every generated harness with exactly one
  non-vacuity cover: a precondition harness covers that the precondition holds
  within the IR bounds, and a contract harness covers, at a point after the
  contract call, that the requires and the IR bounds are jointly satisfiable. A
  backend run that reports success without satisfying that cover has proved
  nothing, and the cover is the only thing that says so.
- When lowering a postcondition or invariant, the generator shall assume every
  package precondition sharing the obligation's anchor operation, emitting each
  as a `requires` on the generated contract and recording it in the harness
  identity's embedded oracles. The claim proved is therefore the obligation
  under those preconditions, and never the obligation alone.
- If a precondition sharing that anchor is not a supported item of the same
  request, then the generator shall refuse the obligation with a typed reason
  naming that precondition and emit no harness, rather than proving the
  obligation under fewer assumptions than the contract states.
- The generator shall lower every obligation against the `cadical` solver and
  without stubbing, and shall record the solver and the complete ordered option
  vector in the harness identity. No option enabling stubbing is emitted,
  because a stub is an assumption this requirement does not admit.
- The generator shall bound every symbolic argument by an inclusive assumption
  taken from its IR `bounded_domain`, and shall require a bounded-integer
  post-state result to remain inside the same domain before the clause can
  hold.
- The generated source shall carry no `#[kani::unwind]`; the unwind bound
  reaches the backend only as an explicit option in the recorded vector, so the
  bound a harness was proved under is read from its identity rather than from
  its text.
- Regeneration from equal inputs shall be byte-identical, and the unwind bound
  and the customer subject shall each change the harness identity.
- If the request names no items, more than 256 items, or an unwind bound
  outside `1..=1024`, then the generator shall refuse the whole request and
  account no item.
- If an otherwise-supported obligation's generated harness source would exceed
  the crate's bounded-resource ceiling, then the generator shall refuse it with
  a distinct resource-limit ground naming the generated size and emit no
  harness; if it fits that ceiling but does not parse as Rust, then the
  generator shall refuse it with a distinct syntax ground naming the parse
  error and emit no harness; neither is reported as the internal-invariant
  fallback used for an otherwise-successful render whose harness could not be
  assembled.
- If a V2 scalar-claim item's graph node carries a tag/form pair the generator
  does not model as a contract role, then the generator shall refuse it with a
  typed reason naming that tag and form and emit no harness, rather than
  accounting it as supported with no contract role recorded; a claim naming a
  node id absent from the graph entirely is likewise refused, with no harness
  emitted.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
|----|----------|--------------|
| FR-015-AC-1 | Pre, post, invariant and frame obligations of one contract produce separate harnesses with distinct identities. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-2 | Every harness identity records its model-domain bounds, taken only from IR `bounded_domain` nodes, and the Kani launcher and driver executable digests, Kani version, CBMC version, solver and options, unwind bound, adapter profile, oracle crate digest and runtime revision. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-3 | An unbounded or non-finite obligation is refused with a typed reason and no harness. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-4 | No harness assumption excludes an undefined, refused or incomplete runtime outcome. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-5 | An obligation whose bounds are unsatisfiable is refused with a typed reason and no harness. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-6 | An obligation over an oracle whose operation identity is `caller_declared` is refused with a typed reason and no harness. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-7 | Every generated harness contains exactly one non-vacuity cover; a precondition harness covers that the precondition holds within the IR bounds, and a contract harness's cover stands after the contract call, so a run that satisfies every check without satisfying the cover is not a proof. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-8 | A postcondition or invariant harness emits every package precondition sharing its anchor operation as a `requires` on its generated contract and records each in its identity's embedded oracles; it embeds no other obligation's oracle; and an obligation whose sibling precondition is not a supported item of the same request is refused with a typed reason naming that precondition and no harness. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-9 | Every harness identity records solver `cadical` and the complete ordered option vector — function contracts, concrete playback, the exact fully qualified harness, `--exact`, the explicit unwind, the explicit solver, `--output-format regular`, and `--concrete-playback print` — and no option enabling stubbing is emitted. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-10 | Regeneration from equal inputs is byte-identical, and changing the unwind bound or the customer subject changes the harness identity digest. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-11 | Every symbolic argument carries an inclusive assumption equal to its IR `bounded_domain`, and a bounded-integer post-state result is required to lie in the same domain; no generated source carries a `#[kani::unwind]`. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-12 | A request naming no items, more than 256 items, an unparsable subject path, or an unwind bound outside `1..=1024` is refused whole, with no item accounted and no harness exposed. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-13 | An otherwise-supported obligation whose generated harness source exceeds the bounded-resource ceiling is refused with a distinct resource-limit reason naming the generated size, and one that fits the ceiling but fails to parse as Rust is refused with a distinct syntax reason naming the parse error; neither is reported as the internal-invariant render-assembly fallback. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-14 | A scalar-claim item whose graph node carries a tag/form pair this generator does not model as a contract role is refused with a typed reason naming that tag and form, and no harness is emitted; a claim naming a node id absent from the graph entirely is refused rather than accounted as supported with no contract role recorded. | Test (TC-025) |
