# FR-015: Generate separate bounded Kani obligations for complete-V1 oracles

## Description

When a caller selects Kani generation for complete-V1 contracts whose scalar
oracles FR-014 generated, the code generator shall emit one bounded Kani
obligation per precondition, postcondition, invariant and frame condition,
each pinned to its backend identity and model-domain bounds. This is issue
#49.

## Inputs

- The FR-014 oracle crate and claim map for the contract's expressions.
- Contract IR's lowered claims and bounds for each obligation.
- The pinned cargo-kani identity, solver and options.

## Outputs

- One Kani harness per obligation kind and claim, with its bounds and backend
  pin recorded in its identity.
- A typed refusal for each obligation that has no finite encoding.

## Behavior

- When generating proofs, the generator shall emit precondition,
  postcondition, invariant and frame obligations as separate harnesses.
- When an obligation has a finite model domain, the generator shall bound
  every symbolic input by that domain without assuming away refused,
  undefined or incomplete outcomes.
- If an obligation's domain is unbounded or its family lacks a finite
  encoding, then the generator shall refuse it with a typed reason and emit no
  harness.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
|----|----------|--------------|
| FR-015-AC-1 | Pre, post, invariant and frame obligations of one contract produce separate harnesses with distinct identities. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-2 | Every harness identity records its model-domain bounds and the pinned Kani version, solver and options. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-3 | An unbounded or non-finite obligation is refused with a typed reason and no harness. | Test (TC-025) |
| FR-015-AC-4 | No harness assumption excludes an undefined, refused or incomplete runtime outcome. | Test (TC-025) |
