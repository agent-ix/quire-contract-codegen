# FR-029: Map every Kani run outcome to QSL's terminal value in one total match

## Description

The Kani adapter shall map every `KaniRunOutcome`, with its inconclusive reason, to QSL's FR-331
terminal value (`qsl_replay::TerminalValue`) in one match with no catch-all arm
([ADR-002](../../decisions/ADR-002-backend-adapter-boundary.md) Q3). Every run outcome maps to
exactly one of QSL's existing terminal values, so every run item has exactly one terminal record, as
QSpec FR-331 requires.

The map covers outcomes of runs only. An item that settles `unsupported`, `requires-bound` or
`invalid-request` settles at negotiation ([FR-019](../../routed/functional/FR-019-capability-settlement.md)), with a
warning naming its capability kind from `quire.capability-kind/v1` (QSpec FR-290) for
`unsupported`. It has no run, no artifact and no terminal value.

## Inputs

- One `KaniRunOutcome` ([FR-017](./FR-017-kani-execution-evidence.md),
  [FR-028](./FR-028-bounded-proof-ceilings.md)) and the SUCCESS check count its transcript reports.

## Outputs

- One `qsl_replay::TerminalValue`.

## Behavior

- The Kani adapter shall map run outcomes in exactly one function whose `match` over
  `KaniRunOutcome` and `KaniInconclusiveReason` has no wildcard arm.
- The Kani adapter shall map each outcome as the table states:

  | Outcome | Result |
  |---|---|
  | `verified`, with `n` SUCCESS checks, `n` at least one | `Proved { success_checks: n }` |
  | `inconclusive` with the vacuous-proof reason (zero SUCCESS checks) | `Proved { success_checks: 0 }` |
  | `cover-unsatisfied` | `Proved { success_checks: 0 }` |
  | `falsified` | `Refuted` |
  | `inconclusive` with the timed-out reason | `Incomplete(IncompleteCause::TimedOut)` |
  | `inconclusive` with the memory-exhausted reason | `Incomplete(IncompleteCause::ResourceExhausted)` |
  | `inconclusive` with the exhausted-unwind-bound reason | `Incomplete(IncompleteCause::ResourceExhausted)` |
  | `inconclusive` with the no-verdict reason | `Failed` |
  | `inconclusive` with the failure-without-counterexample reason | `Failed` |
  | `inconclusive` with the missing-cover-summary reason | `Failed` |

- QSL reads `Proved { success_checks: 0 }` as category `inconclusive` with the vacuity cause
  `KaniVacuousProof`, which is the vacuity record QSpec FR-331-AC-8 requires. A vacuous proof and a
  cover-unsatisfied run are both vacuous: the run established no property over a satisfiable
  domain.
- An exhausted unwind bound is a configured resource bound the run exhausted before it completed. A
  run with no verdict is a build, launcher or solver failure, so the tool failed, not the property.
- A failure without a counterexample and a missing cover summary each map to `Failed`: under the
  option vector every harness identity records, the backend prints a concrete playback for every
  failed check and a cover summary for every run, so either omission is the tool breaking its output
  contract, not a verdict on the property.
- The Kani adapter shall map no outcome to `Tested`.
- The generator shall use QSL's terminal-value type, defining none of its own and importing none
  from Contract IR.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
|----|----------|--------------|
| FR-029-AC-1 | `verified` with three SUCCESS checks maps to `Proved { success_checks: 3 }`, and `falsified` maps to `Refuted`. | Test (TC-040) |
| FR-029-AC-2 | `inconclusive` with the vacuous-proof reason and `cover-unsatisfied` each map to `Proved { success_checks: 0 }`, whose QSL category is `inconclusive` with cause `KaniVacuousProof`. | Test (TC-040) |
| FR-029-AC-3 | The timed-out reason maps to `Incomplete(TimedOut)`, and the memory-exhausted and exhausted-unwind-bound reasons each map to `Incomplete(ResourceExhausted)`. | Test (TC-040) |
| FR-029-AC-4 | The no-verdict reason maps to `Failed`. | Test (TC-040) |
| FR-029-AC-5 | The failure-without-counterexample and missing-cover-summary reasons each map to `Failed`. | Test (TC-040) |
| FR-029-AC-6 | No outcome maps to `Tested`. | Test (TC-040) |

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: [FR-017](./FR-017-kani-execution-evidence.md) and
  [FR-028](./FR-028-bounded-proof-ceilings.md), which classify the outcome; QSL's `qsl-replay`, which
  defines `TerminalValue`; QSL ADR-013 O-16; QSpec FR-331.
- **Downstream**: [TC-040](../matrix/TC-040-run-outcome-terminal-record.md).
